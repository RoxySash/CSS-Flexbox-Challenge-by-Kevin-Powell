My thoughts 

I added this file to give an explanation for my take on this project.

This project was given by Kevin Powell I am almost finished with his 21 day courses and I have learnt so much about CSS, working with grid and flexbox. I always loved flexbox but I learning that certain projects will need the grid layout.
